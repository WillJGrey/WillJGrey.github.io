								<p>Growing up I have memories of the children in my neighborhood gathering around as my grandfather told them stories of all sorts, ever since this upbringing I've had a passion for telling stories, as I got older I realized my love of technology as well. It didn't take long before I realized video editing was not only the perfect mix of the two but something I could fully give my heart and soul to. Ever since I've been editing anything and everything I can get my hands on all the way from being a child toying around with windows movie maker all the way to now with extensive experience in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition. </p>
								<p>After I graduated from secondary education I took on a Bachelors Of Arts in Interactive Arts and Science which is where I gained much of my experience in film making and post-production as well as my experience in fields like Interactive Video and Sound Design. Since then I have worked in a variety of mediums ranging from editing Interviews, Short Films, Documentaries, Experimental Audio, and even editing video game soundtracks. I am a multi-media specialist and am capable of working in many different areas applying the wide variety of skills and expertise I have gained from working in such a diverse set of fields.</p>
